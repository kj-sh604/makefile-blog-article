# Makefile-based Blog Article Generator

**It's simple!**
1. Edit the Markdown File titled `index.md`
2. Open a terminal in the current working directory
3. run `make` or `make -B` (-𝘉 when you've already compiled once)

🎉 **You should now have a file called `index.html` that you can transfer to your blog site's webserver** 🍾

The generated article uses very simple/lightweight css and utilizes light/dark color-schemes via HTML metadata rather than CSS @media tags
